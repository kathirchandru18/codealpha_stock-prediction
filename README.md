# Stock Prediction 

## Project Title: Stock Prediction using LSTM

This repository contains the code for a data science internship project focused on stock price prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The project aims to forecast the future price of a selected stock based on historical data.

### Project Overview:

In this project, we utilize LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, to analyze historical stock price data and make predictions about future prices. LSTM networks are particularly suitable for sequential data like time series due to their ability to retain long-term dependencies.



### Project Structure

- `stock_prediction.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for the stock prediction project. It includes data preprocessing, model building using LSTM, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `data/`: This directory contains any necessary datasets used in the project. It may include historical stock price data for the chosen company.
- `README.md`: You are currently reading the README file which provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

### Project Components:

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - The project involves gathering historical stock price data of the chosen company. This data can be sourced from various financial data providers or APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Before feeding the data into the LSTM model, preprocessing steps such as normalization, feature engineering, handling missing values, and splitting the data into training and testing sets are performed.

3. **Model Development**:
   - The core of the project lies in developing an LSTM model using TensorFlow or a similar deep learning framework. This model learns patterns from the historical stock price data to make future predictions.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The performance of the LSTM model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test dataset.

5. **Prediction Visualization**:
   - Visualizations are generated to illustrate the predicted stock prices alongside the actual prices, allowing for a qualitative assessment of the model's performance.


### Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow 


You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd stock-prediction
```

3. Open the `stock_prediction.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook stock_prediction.ipynb
```

4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute each code cell sequentially. This includes loading the dataset, preprocessing data, building and training the LSTM model, evaluating the model, and making predictions.

### Note

- **Data:** Ensure you have the necessary historical stock price data for the company you want to predict. This data should be placed in the `data/` directory.
- **Model Tuning:** Depending on the performance of the initial model, you may want to experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, or preprocessing techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
